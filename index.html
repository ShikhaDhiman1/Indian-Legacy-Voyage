            <p>
              <strong>Patient:</strong> Is it a boy or a girl?<br /><br />
              <strong>Obstetrician:</strong> Now, I think it's a little early to
              start imposing roles on it, don't you? Now, a word of advice. You
              may find that you suffer for some time a totally irrational
              feeling of depression. PND is what we doctors call it. So it's
              lots of happy pills for you, and you can find out all about the
              birth when you get home. It's available on Betamax, VHS, and Super
              8.

              And spotteth twice they the camels before the third hour. And so
              the Midianites went forth to Ram Gilead in Kadesh Bilgemath by
              Shor Ethra Regalion, to the house of Gash-Bil-Betheul-Bazda, he
              who brought the butter dish to Balshazar and the tent peg to the
              house of Rashomon, and there slew they the goats, yea, and placed
              they the bits in little pots. Here endeth the lesson.

              someone they arrest you — here they'll give you a gun and show you
              what to do, sir. I mean, I killed fifteen of those buggers. Now,
              at home they'd hang me — here they'll give me a fucking medal,

              That’s right, yeah. I’ve had a team working on this over the past
              few weeks, and what we’ve come up with can be reduced to two
              fundamental concepts. One, people are not wearing enough hats.
              Two, matter is energy. In the Universe there are many energy
              fields which we cannot normally perceive. Some energies have a
              spiritual source which act upon a person’s soul. However, this
              soul does not exist ab initio as orthodox Christianity teaches; it
              has to be brought into existence by a process of guided
              self-observation. However, this is rarely achieved owing to man’s
              unique ability to be distracted from spiritual matters by everyday
              trivia.
